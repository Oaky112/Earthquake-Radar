# Earthquake Radar
## Description
"Earthquake Radar" is an innovative mobile application developed during my time at Robert Gordon University, designed to provide users with real-time updates and visualization of seismic activities across geographical regions. Leveraging cutting-edge technology and data from seismic monitoring stations worldwide, the app delivers crucial information about recent earthquakes, including their magnitude, location, depth, and time of occurrence.

## Key Features
Real-time Earthquake Monitoring: Continuously monitors seismic activities globally, fetching data from reliable sources such as the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and other reputable seismic monitoring networks.

Interactive Map Interface: Employs an interactive map interface powered by the Google Maps Android API, allowing users to explore earthquake-prone regions, zoom in for detailed views, and interact with individual earthquake markers for comprehensive information.

Dynamic Marker Placement: Dynamically adds pinpoint markers to the map upon detecting a new earthquake event, accurately indicating the location of the seismic activity. Each marker is color-coded to represent the earthquake's magnitude.

Detailed Earthquake Information: Provides detailed information about each earthquake, including its magnitude on the Richter scale, exact coordinates, depth below the Earth's surface, and precise time of occurrence.

Customizable Alerts: Offers customizable alert settings, enabling users to receive notifications based on their preferred criteria, such as earthquake magnitude thresholds or proximity to their current location.

## Technical Implementation
Google Maps Integration: Seamlessly integrates with the Google Maps Android API to provide an interactive mapping experience.

Data Retrieval from Seismic Networks: Fetches real-time earthquake data from authoritative sources using HTTP requests and APIs.

Dynamic Marker Generation: Programmatically generates marker objects using the Google Maps API, placing them at the corresponding geographic coordinates on the map.

User Alerts and Notifications: Employs background services or asynchronous tasks to periodically check for new earthquake events and trigger notifications to alert the user.

## Color Scheme Selection
The color scheme for Earthquake Radar was chosen deliberately to enhance user experience and convey information effectively. Dark blue was selected as the primary color for several reasons:

Visual Contrast: Dark blue provides a strong visual contrast against the map background, ensuring that earthquake markers and other interface elements stand out prominently for easy identification.

Associations with Water: Dark blue is often associated with water, which is relevant to earthquakes occurring primarily near tectonic plate boundaries, including oceanic regions.

Calm and Trustworthy: Dark blue conveys a sense of calmness and trustworthiness, which is important for an application providing critical information about natural disasters. It instills confidence in users regarding the reliability of the data and the app's functionality.

Accessibility: Dark blue is a color that is generally accessible to users with different visual abilities, ensuring inclusivity and usability for a wide range of individuals.

## Pages and Functionality
Map Page: Provides a real-time interactive map interface for visualizing seismic activity worldwide.

Dashboard Page: Serves as a centralized hub for users to input data and gather comprehensive information about earthquakes they have experienced or witnessed.

Information Section: Offers educational resources and insights about earthquakes and the Earth's movements.
